# Hi, I'm Alessandro 👋🏽	👨🏽‍💻

I'm a passionate frontend developer who loves building sleek, 
responsive web apps with **Angular**, **JavaScript**, and **ReactJS**.
I have a special appreciation for working with APIs and making things
come alive on the screen.
Besides coding, I'm a huge gamer — and honestly, programming often gives me
the same adrenaline rush as beating a boss.
The way code transforms ideas into reality leaves me speechless every time.
I'm all about creativity, clean code, and continuous learning.
